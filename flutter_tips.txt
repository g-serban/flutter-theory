Scaffold  ->  has body, bottomNavigationBar, etc.
							(anything name Bar usually has children, items containing a list)


container has child and takes only one argument (e.g. Row, Column, Scaffold, etc.)
row & column have children and take a list

Container
	-> give a container padding (or margin), e.g. padding: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 70, left: 20),
			- so that you can move your containers position relative to the screen border
	-> you can give the container width and height as well 
	-> use decoration: BoxDecoration(borderRadiu: BorderRadius.smth())  -> if you want to have a border around the container 


-> use SizedBox(height: 40,) to have space between 2 elements (on the cross Axis)
	-> or you can use a container with padding: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 40)
	
	
Row _ and Column 
	-> both have crossAxisAligment and mainAxisAligment properties

Row 	
	-> if you have 2 items on a row and want one to the left and one to the right of the row you can add an expanded between them
		e.g. 
	row(
	  children: [
		Icon(),
		Expanded(child: Container()),
		Container()
